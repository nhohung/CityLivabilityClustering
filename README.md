# CityLivabilityClustering

The project has grouped the most 358 popular cities in the world based on their similarity. The similarity between these cities are measured based on the 6 main living indexes, including crime, health, culture, nature, education, and infrastructure. Three main city groups are determined associating to living, working and resting conditions.
