Could be a new job, could be relocation closer to your family, or could be that you want to try life in a different country. If that day comes, the most nature question you will have is “how is the new city different/similar from my current place”. In this project, I collect 6 democratic information from popular cities in the world, categories their differences, and put similar cities in groups.\n",
